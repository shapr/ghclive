Prototypes
----------
The prototypes subdirectory contains several quick hacks demonstrating various concepts.

### Using hint to download and execute code from the web ###

prototypes/hintdownload/ is the example.hs from http://code.haskell.org/hint/devel/examples/
modified to download and execute Demo.main from http://www.scannedinavian.com/~shae/Demo.hs

prototypes/scottywebexecute/ is examples/basic.hs from https://github.com/xich/scotty/
modified only slightly to prove to myself that I understand the code.
